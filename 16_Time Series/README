🚕 Sweet Lift Taxi – Hourly Demand Forecasting
📌 Project Overview

Sweet Lift Taxi has collected historical data on airport taxi orders.
To optimize driver allocation during peak hours, the company needs to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour.

The objective of this project is to build a time series forecasting model that predicts hourly taxi demand while achieving a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) ≤ 48 on the test set.

🎯 Business Objective

Accurate short-term demand prediction enables:

Better driver allocation during peak hours

Reduced passenger wait time

Improved operational efficiency

Data-driven workforce planning

📊 Dataset Description

File: /datasets/taxi.csv

Target variable:

num_orders → Number of taxi orders

The data contains historical timestamps and order counts.

🧠 Methodology
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Converted timestamp to datetime format

Resampled data into hourly intervals

Sorted chronologically

Verified missing values and temporal consistency

df = df.resample('1H').sum()

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Time series visualization

Trend and seasonality analysis

Rolling mean and rolling standard deviation

Seasonal decomposition

Stationarity analysis

Insights:

Strong daily seasonality pattern

Clear demand peaks during specific hours

Trend component indicating variation over time

3️⃣ Feature Engineering

To convert the time series into a supervised learning problem:

Lag features (previous hours demand)

Rolling statistics

Hour of day

Day of week

Example:

df['lag_1'] = df['num_orders'].shift(1)
df['rolling_mean'] = df['num_orders'].rolling(24).mean()

4️⃣ Train/Test Split

Last 10% of the dataset used as test set

Chronological split (no random shuffling)

5️⃣ Models Trained

Multiple models were evaluated with hyperparameter tuning:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting

(Optional) CatBoost / XGBoost

Cross-validation performed using time-series aware strategy.

📈 Evaluation Metric

Metric used: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Project constraint:

RMSE on test set must be ≤ 48
